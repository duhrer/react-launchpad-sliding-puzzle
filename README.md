# react-launchpad-slide puzzle.

This project presents a gridded number puzzle with one empty square.  Clicking or pressing enter on a square that shares a row with an empty square will "slide" squares into the empty square.

If you just want to see a live demo, it's hosted [on my GitHub Pages](https://duhrer.github.io/demos/react-launchpad-slide-puzzle/).

To run the project in development mode, use `npm start`.

To build a production instance of this project for use on a static site, use `npm run build`.
